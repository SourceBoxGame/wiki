# QScript Tutorial Page 1: Mods

QScript operates on "mods" which are folders inside the `sourcebox/mods/` directory.

Make a new directory called "TutorialMod" inside it. This will be the mod you will be operating on in the tutorial.

Before you can begin coding anything, you have to pick a language.

QScript currently supports the following lanugages:

* [Lua][QScript/Lua/Intro]

* [Squirrel][QScript/Squirrel/Intro]

* Python

Go to the language you will be using to learn about the QScript specific changes for each language.

After you learned what you need to know, go to the next page.
