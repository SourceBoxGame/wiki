# QScript Tutorial Page 2: Getting to work

In your freshly created folder, make a new file called `autorun_client` with the extension of your favorite programming language that QScript supports.

Currently, QScript is in the "DO NOT USE" stage, which means that the only implemented bindings are:

* `sourcebox_client.Msg()` takes a string and prints it to the console.
* `sourcebox_client.RegisterCmd()` takes a string and a function (in said order) and registers that as a console command.
