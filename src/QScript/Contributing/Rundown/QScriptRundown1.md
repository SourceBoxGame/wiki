# QScript Rundown Page 1

QScript is like onions. It has layers. 

1. Game
2. QScript
3. Interfaces
4. Languages

The top layer is the game itself. That's where you talk with QScript to add modules, functions, classes, objects, etc.

QScript is the second layer, it talks with the language interfaces about what files to load, what functions to call, etc.

Interfaces actually talk with the scripting languages themselves. But to QScript, each one behaves the same way. There **cannot** be any language specific functionalities that are related to QScript and not the lanugage itself.
